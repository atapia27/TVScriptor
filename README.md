# TVScriptor
**A Python tool for generating compelling television scripts using recurrent neural networks, natural language processing, and deep learning text generation techniques.**

This is a script that uses a machine learning model to generate text that is similar to a provided input text. It does this by training a single layer LSTM model on the input text, and using the trained model to predict the next character in a sequence of characters. The model is trained using the TensorFlow library and the text is vectorized and processed using the numpy and io libraries. The generated text is created by sampling from the predicted probability distribution of the next character, with a higher temperature resulting in more randomness in the generated text. The script includes helper functions to sample from a probability array, and to map unique characters in the input text to indices. The script also includes a function to determine the number of characters in each line of the input text. The script loads and reads the input text, preprocesses the data, and trains the model using the preprocessed data. The script then uses the trained model to generate text, and outputs the generated text after each iteration of training.

Current training data comes from the first two seasons of the popular TV show, The Office.
