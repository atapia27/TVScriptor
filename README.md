# TVScriptor
**A Python tool for generating compelling television scripts using recurrent neural networks, natural language processing, and deep learning text generation techniques.**

This code is using a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to perform text generation. It does this by training the model on a given text corpus and using the trained model to generate new text by predicting the next character given a sequence of characters from the text. The model is trained using the TensorFlow library and the text is vectorized and processed using the numpy and io libraries. The generated text is created by sampling from the predicted probability distribution of the next character, with a higher temperature resulting in more randomness in the generated text. The model is trained for a certain number of iterations and the generated text is outputted after each iteration.


LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is specifically designed to remember patterns over long periods of time. RNNs are a type of neural network that are designed to process sequential data, such as time series, natural language, or music. LSTMs are a variant of RNNs that have a more complex architecture, which allows them to learn longer-term dependencies and avoid the vanishing gradient problem.

In this code, the diversity value is a hyperparameter used in the text generation process. It determines the "creativity" or "randomness" of the generated text by controlling the temperature of the softmax function in the model's output layer.


Vectorization is the process of converting data into a numerical form that can be processed by a machine learning model. In the context of this code, the input data is a sequence of characters and the output data is a single character. These data are represented as arrays of boolean values, where each position in the array corresponds to a unique character in the text.

The input data is stored in a 3D numpy array called x, and the output data is stored in a 2D numpy array called y. The array x has dimensions (len(sentences), maxlen, len(chars)), where len(sentences) is the number of sequences, maxlen is the length of each sequence, and len(chars) is the number of unique characters in the text. The array y has dimensions (len(sentences), len(chars)), where len(sentences) is the number of sequences and len(chars) is the number of unique characters in the text.
